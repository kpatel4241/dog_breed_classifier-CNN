Dog Breed Classifier using Keras


In this project, we'll build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. 
Given an image of a dog, our algorithm will identify an estimate of the dog breed. 

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, we'll make important design decisions.
Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.


We'll be doing :
================
Step 0: Import Datasets

Step 1: Detect Humans

Step 2: Detect Dogs

Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)

Step 4: Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)

Step 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
